            <p>
                I am  full stack developer, specialising
                in Javascript based frameworks. I enjoy
                creating and making things look nice.
            </p>        
            <p>
                I also have a love towards backend development.
                The ability to pass values to functions and
                telling it to do things for you step by step
                is just pure automation process.
            </p>

                I am a very hands-on person. I love crafting.
                I have crafted multiple items such as photoframe, 
                a scented notebook, string board and many more.
                This is where my imagination and creativity flows.
